## Introduction
Hello, my name is Diana

I am from Riga, Latvia, and I am 22 years old. Since finishing school, I have been on a journey of self-discovery. Two years ago, I ventured into the field of IT and soon realized that programming was my true calling. I acquired knowledge in several programming languages during my participation in QA courses, including JavaScript and HTML. Additionally, I took it upon myself to learn Python independently. Witnessing how code transforms into something functional fascinated me.

However, I began pondering which specific field within programming truly inspired me and where I wanted to build my career. While exploring various programs at a university exhibition, I stumbled upon game programming. It struck me that I could aspire to become a game programmer one day. Since that moment, I embarked on my journey to become a game programmer, and currently, I am deeply immersed in learning C++.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I thoroughly enjoy watching TV series and films with my friends, playing video games, drumming, reading books, and learning languages. I have a particular fondness for books in the field of psychology, as they help me gain a deeper understanding of both myself and the people around me. Occasionally, I also take a break from the wealth of information and delve into novels from classic and modern literature.

Currently, I am in the process of learning Spanish, French, and Japanese. Japanese is proving to be a bit challenging for me, but I find that learning languages allows me not only to grasp a new language but also to immerse myself in the culture of the people who speak it and make fascinating new acquaintances.

Speaking of films, I have a strong inclination towards fantasy movies, with the latest installment of my favorites being 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.'

Last year, due to a heavy workload and studies, I didn't have much time for all my hobbies and video games, but I still made an effort to explore new games. One of my all-time favorite games is 'The Last of Us'; it holds a special place in my heart.
