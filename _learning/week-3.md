This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?

In this week i am planning, to fill out my game description document, and to find game assets that i want to use in my game. I am planning to wath lectures and materials about class and function templates and Standard Template Library. Although I want to spend some time on repeating the previous week materials, and maybe wath some materials to deeeply understand the topics.
During Lab time on lectures, i want to start creating my game.

## Do

<!---
NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

During this week i have watched all lectures, and read material from book Chapter 10,17,20. Also I uploaded an app to my phone for coding and learning C++ which called Sololearn, and it help me to better understand what type of code what is doing. I just started to using this app, so it helped me to review some materials that i have lerned during 1st and 2nd week.
During Labs i added my character to my game, and wrote a code to make him moving.


## Check

<!--- 
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

I already started to code something, but it is not as good as i thought, i want to implement an animation of runing for example for my character, and unforunately i didnt. It was really difficult for me to understand how to add an asset for character, and it took much more time than i thought.
I had a problem with the assets that i choose, All sprites were in different files, and i dint find the solution how to add it, but in the end i just found the assets that i could add to my project. So during this week i didnt add anything additional that we made during that class.
But i have rewatch twice lectures and i thing i understand good what we was learning. 
Also I didnt fill out my game design document, why i am dissapointed, because i needed to do it before starting creating my game.

## Act

<!---
Note: Fill this in at the end of the week.

What action points can you identify from this week? What would you like to improve? What would you like to continue to strengthen?

If your planned time estimates were not accurate, what would you do to improve them?

Next week i want to plann my learning time more efficiently, to continue doing what i have planned for this week, so it would be all done. I want to spend more time on coding, and understandinfg how it works, started to use libraries on my own, and adding new things to my game.
