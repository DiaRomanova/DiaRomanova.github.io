## Plan

In this week i want to start to work an assigment, especially create my games design document, and even if i wont finish it this week, just to start it at least. Although i will start to learn themes as: pointers and references, classes, statements and functions. To learn that i will listen lectures, and read special chapters for that from book. I hope that i will have the ability to spend on it 3-4 hours a day at least.

## Do

During this week, I noticed that learning became more challenging for me, as I wasn't feeling well. However, towards the end of the week, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, I had the opportunity to dedicate more time to my studies. I watched the recorded lectures twice because I didn't grasp everything on the first pass. Fortunately, it didn't take me longer than I had anticipated.

Nonetheless, I ended up spending less time on my studies than I would have preferred. I managed to read chapters from the book, took notes, and uploaded my game design document to Microsoft Teams.
