This is a description of your learning experiences. You can use markdown like any other post.

## Plan

I am planning to begin studying the fundamentals of C++, including the build process (Chapter 1 of the book) and fundamental data types (Chapter 2 of the book). I'll be participating in lectures to gain a better understanding of how C++ works. If I encounter any additional information that I need to understand, I will use Google to search for it and figure out how it works.
<!---
NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?

## Do

I have started to learn the 1st Chapter of the book, about build process for C++, it takes me more time than i thought, so in the future i might think to have more time for thath, because i havent larnt something like that before, and it took me really much time to understand
