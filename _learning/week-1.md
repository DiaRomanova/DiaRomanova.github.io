## Plan

I am planning to begin studying the fundamentals of C++, including the build process (Chapter 1 of the book) and fundamental data types (Chapter 2 of the book). I'll be participating in lectures to gain a better understanding of how C++ works. If I encounter any additional information that I need to understand, I will use Google to search for it and figure out how it works.

NOTE: Fill this section in at the beginning of the week!

What do you plan to do this week? What new knowledge do you want to acquire? Do you want to follow any of the learning units for the course? Do you want to work on the assignment for the course? How much time do you estimate you will spend on these tasks?

## Do

I've started studying the first chapter of the book, which delves into the build process for C++. It's taking me more time than I initially anticipated. Since this is a new concept for me, I'm finding it quite challenging to grasp. In the future, I may need to allocate more time to this topic due to its complexity.

Additionally, I've been diligent about taking notes during the lectures to help me quickly access the information I need when I need it.

Overall, I would like to deepen my understanding of the topics covered this week, so I'm not entirely satisfied with my progress.

NOTE: Fill this in during the week.

What were you actually able to accomplish? Was it more or less than what you planned? Was the amount of time you thought you would spend on it accurate? If not, what took longer than you thought it would?

Provide as much context as possible. Use code snippets or take screenshots of what you were able to accomplish. Please provide references to any additional sources of information that helped you.

## Check


In the first week, I acquainted myself with the basics of the programming language C++ and began contemplating the type of game I would like to create. Understanding fundamental data types proved challenging, as my mathematical skills had become a bit rusty since my last study. Therefore, I plan to allocate additional time to this topic in the second week. I've come to realize that this programming language is more complex than I initially thought, but I'm hopeful that I will gradually unravel its intricacies, and everything will become clearer. I also managed to grasp how to use GitHub and how to publish my code, although it took a few attempts to truly remember the process.

What went well? What didn't go so well? What was the most important thing you learned this week?

Did you receive any feedback from the lecturer or your peers? If so, what was that feedback? Were you able to incorporate that feedback?

Did you give anyone else feedback? Who did you give feedback to? How did they respond to your feedback?

NOTE: Any source of feedback is feedback!

## Act

This week, I immersed myself more in studying and reading, and I would like to incorporate practical exercises to gain a fuller understanding of how everything works. I realized that I didn't manage my time properly, so next week, I plan to allocate specific hours each day to ensure I have enough time to grasp all the material thoroughly.
